#High Level Algorithm 

##1. Parse the play

##2. Count number of lines for each speaker

##3. Get a list of speakers in each scene

##4. Create an empty graph

##5. Add nodes to the graph
(for every person that speaks in the act, we will draw a node to represent them. The more lines they say, the larger the node)

##6. Add lines/edges to the graph
(draw an line/edge between nodes if they appear in the same scene together, the more scenes they appear in together the thicker the line)

##7. Save the graph to an image
